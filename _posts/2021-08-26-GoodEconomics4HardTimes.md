[Good Economics for Hard Times](https://www.goodeconomicsforhardtimes.com/) is a great book by Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo, professors of economics at MIT. It discusses topics such as trade, jobs and migration that are currently dominating the political discourse. One of the most interesting insights is that immigrants are often more productive in their new homes than they would be back home, in part because they are willing to try new jobs and discover professions to which they are better suited. 
The book also contains some counterintuitive insights on food security. Spoiler alert: it's not only about having enough money for a certain amount of calories, food also needs to taste good. People also sacrifice food budgets sometimes for a more stimulating life.
