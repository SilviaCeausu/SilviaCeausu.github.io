Check out the [CBER Lunchbox Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKYTvTbXFuChwnj9kVKqVl5XPZrU9P7bk), Season 2. In this set of 3 episodes, we talk to Dr. Sarobidy Rakotonarivo about research and academic life in Madagascar, with Joshua Powell about carnivore conservation and wildlife trade, and with Prof. Pep Serra-Diaz about transalting ecological research into management actions and nurturing diversity in academia. I am the host interviewing Sarobidy and Pepe and you can find the transcripts of the conversations with Sarobidy [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SilviaCeausu/SilviaCeausu.github.io/main/podcast/transcript_Sarobidy.txt) and with Pep [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SilviaCeausu/SilviaCeausu.github.io/main/podcast/transcripts_Pep.txt).
