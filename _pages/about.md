I am a conservation scientist at the [Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/departments/genetics-evolution-and-environment/research/centre-biodiversity-and-environment-research-cber) at University College London.

My goal is to develop tools and insights that support sustainable human development and human-wildlife coexistence. I am particularly interested in how biodiversity responds to human activities, and how humans interact and derive benefits from their environment. 

The answers to many conservation questions are at the intersection of traditional research disciplines. Therefore, I am very keen to explore new connections between conservation and other research areas. At the moment, I mainly draw from ecology, economics and human geography. 

 My research is focused on three major themes: 

* conservation and rewilding in agricultural landscapes. I am currently researching biodiversity impacts of agricultural expansion and intensification as part of my research within the [GCRF TRADE Hub project](https://tradehub.earth/). 
* internal human migration in low and middle income countries in collaboration with [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org/) and [Flowminder](https://www.flowminder.org/). 
* human-environment interactions that brings together my research on ecosystem services, human-wildlife coexistence and human geography.
