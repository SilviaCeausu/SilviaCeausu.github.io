I am a conservation scientist at the [Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/departments/genetics-evolution-and-environment/research/centre-biodiversity-and-environment-research-cber) at University College London.

My goal is to develop tools and insights that support sustainable human development and coexistence between biodiversity and people. I am particularly interested in how biodiversity responds to human activities, and how humans interact with biodiversity and derive benefits from it through ecosystem services. The answers to many of the major questions in conservation are at the intersection between traditional research disciplines. This suits my natural impulse to explore and create new connections between conservation and other research areas. Currently, I mainly draw from ecology, economics and human geography. 

 My research is focused on three major themes: 

* biodiversity impacts of agricultural expansion and intensification as part of my research within the [GCRF TRADE Hub project](https://tradehub.earth/)
* internal human migration in low and middle income countries in collaboration with [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org/) and [Flowminder](https://www.flowminder.org/)
* human-environment interactions that unifies my research on ecosystem services, human-wildlife coexistence and human geography.
