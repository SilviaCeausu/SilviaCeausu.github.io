I am a conservation scientist interested in how biodiversity responds to human activities, and how humans interact with biodiversity and derive benefits from it through ecosystem services. My goal is to develop tools and insights that support human development and sustainable coexistence between biodiversity and people. To achieve this goal, I draw in my research from ecology, economics and human geography. 

 My research is focused on three major themes: 

* biodiversity impacts of agricultural expansion and intensification as part of my research within the [GCRF TRADE Hub project](https://tradehub.earth/)
* internal human migration in low and middle income countries in collaboration with [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org/) and [Flowminder](https://www.flowminder.org/)
* human-environment interactions that unifies my research on ecosystem services, human-wildlife coexistence and human geography. 

I am based at the [Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/departments/genetics-evolution-and-environment/research/centre-biodiversity-and-environment-research-cber) at University College London.
