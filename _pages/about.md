I am a conservation scientist interested in how biodiversity responds to human activities, and how humans interact with biodiversity and derive benefits from it through ecosystem services. My goal is to develop tools and insights that support human development and sustainable coexistence between biodiversity and humans. I draw from ecology, economics and human geography to develop and implement interdisciplinary approaches. I am currently a postdoc at the [Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/departments/genetics-evolution-and-environment/research/centre-biodiversity-and-environment-research-cber) at University College London.

 My research is focused on three major themes: 

* spatial and statistical models of how biodiversity is responding to agricultural expansion and intensification as part of my research within the [GCRF TRADE Hub project](https://tradehub.earth/)
* internal human migration in low and middle income countries in collaboration with [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org/) and [Flowminder](https://www.flowminder.org/)
* human-environment interactions that unifies my research interests in ecosystem services, human-wildlife coexistence and human geography.
