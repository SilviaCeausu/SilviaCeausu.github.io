# Teaching

* 2018		Lecture on human-wildlife coexistence, Biogeography & Macroecology - postgraduate course, Aarhus University. 
* 2018		Supervision of four students conducting a 9 weeks research project for Theory and Practice in Biological Research – undergraduate course, Aarhus University. 
* 2017		Lecture on conservation planning and area prioritization, Biogeography & Macroecology - master course, Aarhus University. In addition to the lecture itself, I conducted a ![practical exercise](ConservationExercise.pdf) on conservation planning and guided discussions among the students. In this exercise, each square represents a spatial unit and each animal shape represents a species. There is not one correct answer and the exercise provides an opportunity to discuss themes such as fragmentation and poplation size. 
* 2015		Teaching Assistant (R programming), Spatial Ecology course - master program, Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg.  
* 2012		Teaching Assistant (R programming), Theoretical Ecology course - undergraduate program, Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon, Portugal.
