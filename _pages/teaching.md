* 2018		Lecture on human-wildlife coexistence, Biogeography & Macroecology - postgraduate course, Aarhus University. 
* 2018		Supervision of four students conducting a 9 weeks research project for Theory and Practice in Biological Research – undergraduate course, Aarhus University. 
* 2017		Lecture on conservation planning and area prioritization, Biogeography & Macroecology - master course, Aarhus University. In addition to the lecture itself, I conducted a practical exercise on conservation planning based on the simplified landscape below. The students were asked to designed a protected area that would protect all or as many species as possible.

Here, each square represents a spatial unit and each animal shape represents a species. There is not one correct answer and the exercise provides an opportunity to discuss themes such as fragmentation and poplation size.
